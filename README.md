Dual Timer Demo – Synchronous vs Asynchronous Illustration

This Python program demonstrates the difference between synchronous and asynchronous behavior using two timers (threads):

Number Timer: Prints numbers in bursts of three, updating every 2 seconds.

Bar Timer: Prints "|" continuously every 0.5 seconds.

The program uses Python threading to run both timers simultaneously, showing how asynchronous tasks operate independently, unlike synchronous tasks.

It’s a simple example to visualize concurrency and the concept of independent timers in Python, perfect for educational purposes in synchronization and concurrency classes.
